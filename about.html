                <p>"My plans are usually quite minimal, but then, almost habitually, I end up taking the grand way!"- This, truly describes Shuvam Mitra as a whole.</p>
                
                <p>Being a student, photohrapher, coder, web designer an a graphic designer, all at once, is no child's play! Added to the fact that he keeps his love for, aviation, playing badminton, watching series, listening to music, enjoying memes and playing games all alive at the same time. All of these don't alter the fact that he incessantly keeps improving in each one of these while being a true friend to all he knows, a kind human and someone who is great at managing and befriending people! Phew, no wonder that his humble way of life runs on the oxymoronous tracks of, "Go Big!"</p>

                <p> P.S: As far as what his friends claim, a serious mentorship from him in juggling between all these roles, keeping life together and also being such a lovable human being is the need of the hour!</p>
